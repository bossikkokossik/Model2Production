# Anomaly Detection in IoT: A Production-Ready Application

This repository houses a machine learning application designed for anomaly detection within IoT devices. By leveraging a dataset openly available for training, the application simulates IoT sensor output and presents prediction results through a user-friendly web-based GUI.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The application identifies anomalies in IoT systems and offers a streamlined experience for users through its intuitive browser-accessible interface. It serves as a tool for those looking to deploy machine learning models efficiently in the realm of IoT.

## ðŸ“‹ Preliminary Information

To fully harness the capabilities of this application, certain preparatory steps are recommended.

### Prerequisites:

- A suitable dataset for model training is necessary. The [AnoML-IoT dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hkayan/anomliot) is suggested as a starting point. If a different dataset is employed, column name adjustments may be required for compatibility.

### ðŸ›  Installation & Operation Guide

Follow this simple step-by-step installation and operation guide:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Retrieve the code base:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/Model2Production.git
   ```

2. **Project Directory Navigation**:
   ```sh
   cd Model2Production
   ```

3. **Dataset Integration**:
   Position the dataset file (`dataset.csv`) in the project directory.

4. **Python Environment Setup**:
   A Python environment should be created (ensure Python is installed):
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

5. **Environment Activation**:
   - **For Linux/MacOS**:
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **For Windows**:
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

6. **Installing Dependencies**:
   Execute the following to install necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Conducting Model Training**:
   Start the training process with the provided dataset:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```

8. **Prediction Server Initiation**:
   Begin the server for predictions:
   ```sh
   python server.py
   ```

9. **User Interface Activation**:
   In a new terminal window, reactivate the environment and run the UI application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

10. **Accessing the User Interface**:
    Open a web browser and navigate to:
    ```plaintext
    localhost:5000
    ```

11. **Operational Use for Anomaly Detection**:
    To test sensor data, select and submit for real-time anomaly evaluation.

12. **Terminating the Process**:
    To halt the inspection, use the `STOP` button.

13. **Conclusion of Use**:
    To finish, close the browser window and terminate the terminal sessions.

> Note: For Unix systems, the `python3` command should replace `python` in the instructions above.
